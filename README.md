# Godot Scala Template (Linux)

This is a template project for using the [Godot Kotlin JVM module](https://github.com/utopia-rise/godot-kotlin-jvm) with Scala.

Currently, the **Godot Kotlin JVM module** itself does not provide an official release of Scala support.  
However, a working version is available in its `develop` branch.

The **`v1.0.0` release** of this template contains:
- A Godot build with Scala support
- Prebuilt Maven packages with Scala integration
